# Cellphone-Price-Analysis
Analyzed smartphones to uncover how hardware specifications (RAM, PPI, CPU, etc.) impact pricing. Used Python for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to identify key trends that influence smartphone costs.

## 🚀 Technical Stack
**Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook<br />
**Methods**: Correlation analysis, outlier detection, visualization

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
✅ **Data Cleaning** – Handled duplicates, missing values, and outliers<br />
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovered correlations between specs and price<br />
✅ **Data Visualization** – Created heatmaps, scatter plots, and box plots to communicate insights<br />
✅ **Statistical Analysis** – Calculated Pearson correlations to quantify relationships<br />
✅ **Business Insight Generation** – Translated findings into actionable recommendations<br />
